On March 11th, a devastating earthquake and a tsunami caused by it
struck Japan. Tens of thousands lost their lives that day, tens of
thousands now miss a loved one.<p/>

Among the consequences of the disaster there was unprecedented damage
to the Nuclear Power Plant Fukushima Daiichi (Fukushima 1). The ruin
is leaking poison right at the moment and will not stop doing so for
years. Nobody ever cleaned up a radioactivity spill of that size and
probably nobody even can do so. I do not think any of my contemporarys
will live long enough to see a resolution of this crisis.<p/>

To heighten awareness of the fact that the accident in Fukushima is
not over, not even contained, that the fire is not put out, I will
publish here Data of thermometers in Reactor 2. Reactor 2 is
interesting because it's thermometers are the only ones which do not
show it's contents cooling down.<p/>

The Media are blaming this on an instrument failure. Instrument
failure, however, is not bound to happen on several instruments at
onces, and thermocouple failures usually do not look much like this.<p/>

Everybody is bound to make their own conclusions. The original Data in
Text Form is
